    "How do quantum algorithms running on quantum computers actually work? A truly quantum algorithm utilizes quantum interference to enhance the probability amplitude for the right answer and reduce that for the wrong answers, as it evolves an input state based on the superposition of all possible states (possible answers). A natural question is then to ask how the algorithm manages to \"choreograph\" such interference pattern. The goal of this notebook (\"virtual talk\") is to develop an intuition for design choices behind such \"choreography\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The original topic of the talk was going to be about quantum Fourier transform (QFT), and how it is used in Shor's algorithm for factorizing composite integers. It seemed appropriate as Shor's algorithm is an arguably useful quantum algorithm that has exponential speedup compared to classical factoring algorithms. However, it became clear that diving directly into the analysis of Shor's algorithm, especially without previous exposure to quantum algorithms, is quite laborious. So I will focus on an easier, seemingly unrelated problem that, in Shor's own words, inspired him to write his algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the structure of the notebook. I will review common qubit operations that can be found in quantum circuits as a nice warm-up. Then I will describe quantum black box models in general and why people were motivated to come up with early quantum algorithms within that theoretical background. Then I will describe Simon's problem within that context and Simon's algorithm that quantumly solves the problem. I will finish by touching briefly on Shor's algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of the writing below is based on the [online textbook for Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/textbook/preface.html), which is a Python based quantum computation library made by IBM. For more theoretical understanding I consulted Scott Aaronson's [lecture notes](https://www.scottaaronson.com/qclec/combined.pdf), in particular Chapter 17 and beyond."

    "The Hadamard gate $H$ is a single qubit gate that transforms from the $\\{0,1\\}$ basis to $\\{|+\\rangle,|-\\rangle\\}$ basis, and vice versa. The two superposition states $\\{|+\\rangle,|-\\rangle\\}$ are written in the ordinary $\\{0,1\\}$ basis as $\\{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle\\right), \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(|0\\rangle - |1\\rangle\\right)\\}$.

Note that the Hadamard gate is not physically equivalent to a $\\pi/2$ Rabi pulse, although both operations put a qubit in 0 or 1 into some superposition state. You can think of the Hadamard gate as a $\\pi-$rotation around the $\\hat{X}+\\hat{Z}$ axis through the Bloch sphere. Alternatively, you can think of it as a $\\pi-$rotation around the $\\hat{Z}$ axis followed by a $\\pi/2-$rotation around the $\\hat{Y}$ axis. \n",

    "Let's take a step back and remind ourselves why we are interested in quantum computers. We hear and learn that quantum computers are powerful. But powerful in what sense? It has to easily solve problems that classical computers take a long time solving. What we mean by \"easy\" is that the number of elementary steps taken to produce the desired answer is relatively small. In the case of classical computers, that elementary step can be a floating point operation, for example. What about quantum computers? Maybe that could be the number of rudimentary gates used to construct the unitary transformation that transforms your input state to the desired output state. So if we were to have a quantum algorithm and prove its supremacy, we would have to look at what kind of unitary transformation it is trying to implement, come up with a lower bound on the number of gates to realize that unitary, and show that it is small. \n",
    "\n",
    "So far everything I said here seems natural, but the catch is that determination of the circuit complexity of a unitary is insanely hard, according to experts. Even worse, that hardness has nothing to do with quantum mechanics. There are possibly some situations where even the upper bound is guaranteed to be relatively small, but outside of that circuit complexity is not best suited to show the strengths of quantum computers. This motivates us to consider a more limited model of complexity, and that is query complexity. \n",

    "The query complexity of an algorithm is measured by the number of queries made to a black-box function (also known as *oracle* in computer science). The only thing you know about the given black-box function is that it exists (don't worry about whether it *can* exist), and gives you an output bitstring $f(x)$ if you give it an input bitstring $x$, where $f:\\{0,1\\}^n \\to \\{0,1\\}^m$. The task at hand is then trying to learn some property of this black-box only by making queries instead of looking at its internals. And the fewer the number of queries, the better the algorithm is. Note that this means, we count any gates that come before or after queries as cost-free. Is it possible that by querying on a superposition of inputs, and getting back a superposition of answers, I learn more about the black-box function than making a random queue of queries? We will see. "

    "### 2.2 Making quantum queries <a id = quantumquery></a>\n",
    "Hopefully I have convinced you that studying queries to black-box functions is worth our time. Now let's learn how to make a query quantum mechanically.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with two qubit registers: the first one for the input string, and the second for storing the result of the query. After the query, our input state $|x,y\\rangle$ will transform into $|x,y \\oplus f(x)\\rangle$. If $y$ is all zeros, then we have written the query result into the second register. And of course, if $y$ is all ones, then we get the binary complement of $f(x)$. This mode of storing query into the state of the qubit register is known as XOR query.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another method of making a query, and that is phase query: you encode the query result into the phase of the amplitude rather than into the state: $(-1)^{f(x)}|x\\rangle$. You can also this variant where we append a control qubit $|b\\rangle$ and if you pass $|x,b\\rangle$ as an input, you get out $(-1)^{f(x)\\cdot b}|x,b\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me say again that we don't care what kind of gates are inside the black-box function. We just assume that it can do what we want, as a phase query or an XOR query. And it turns out that you can turn an XOR query into  a phase query and vice versa, at no cost. Hint: Start from $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(|x,0\\rangle - |x,1\\rangle\\right)$ as an input to an XOR query.\n",
    "\n",
    "To end this section, let's review **Deutsch's algorithm**, which is one of the earliest quantum algorithm from the mid 1980's. It gives a simple flavor of the quantum black-box problem.\n",

    "> Suppose we are given two unknown bits $b_0$ and $b_i$.\n",

Applying a final Hadamard, we get $|0\\rangle$ or $|1\\rangle$, and this is indeed the parity of the two-bit set. So in general, for a n-bit input, Deutsch's algorithm reduces classical query complexity by half. It's not impressive, I know, but it's simple enough to understand. And things start to get interesting from here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, you will also read about **Deutsche-Jozsa algorithm** and **Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm** but let me skip ahead to **Simon's algorithm** to save your reading time boxes). Deutsche-Josza algorithm is basically a n-qubit extension to the simple Deutsche algorithm above: just replace the Hadamards $H$ at the front and at the back with $H^{\\otimes n}$ respectively. Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm has essentially the same structure, but for a different problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are bored at this point and ready to quit, just remember that solving black-box model generally has the structure of Hadamarding the input, sending into a query, and Hadamarding again the query result, regardless of the problems described! Keeping this mental picture will make the reading of the references smoother. Understanding the example and the exercise given in [Section 1.1](#hadamardgate) will help a lot."

Simon was convinced that there is a limit to achieving a \"true\" exponential quantum speedup with quantum algorithms. He ended up proving that there is such one for an artificial problem (and as Shor found out, similarly for the not-so-artificial problem of factoring integers). What we mean by \"true\" speedup is that we allow classical computers to try non-deterministic, probabilistic answers to improve their speed, and compare our quantum speedup to that.\n",

    "In other words, if an input string has some output, the complement to the input string also has the same output. Otherwise, all distinct inputs not related as complements give distinct outputs. Thus, $f$ is a two-to-one function. An example would be $f(n) = 2\\cdot \\mathrm{floor}[n/2] + 1$, giving outputs 1,1,3,3,5,5, for inputs 0,1,2,3,4,5. Translated into binaries, this would be (restricting to 3 bits) output list of 001,001,011,011,101,101 for input list of 000,001,010,011,100,101. We see that the secret bitstring $s$ is 001. \n",

    "The example above was easy to solve in the sense that the two equivalent outputs were nearest neighbors, so we only needed the first two queries to make a guess at $s$. But what if equivalent outputs are scattered around in random fashion, and we have a n-bit long input string? In the worse case, you will have to query $2^{n-1} + 1$ to detect two equivalent outputs and answer the problem without error.\n",
    "\n",
    "In principle, the probability of having only dissimilar outputs decreases as the number of query increases. You may be familiar with the [birthday problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem) - to reach 50% chance of at least two people in a room, sharing a birthday, you only need 23 people. Note $\\sqrt{365} \\approx 19$. If there were $n$ days in a year, you would need in general $\\approx \\sqrt{n}$ people in a room to have a decent chance of sharing a birthday. This is due to the quadratic scaling of numbers of pairs as number of people in the room grows (i.e. collision chance grows fast). By this logic, classically, if you allow some error, you can determine $s$ within $O(2^{n/2})$ with high probability. Let's accept for now that you cannot do better than this scaling for classical computers.\n",

In principle, if the algorithm can pick out $y-x$ after each query, after a few queries, we can take the greatest common divisor of the $(y-x)$ we have measured and that would already be a very good guess.
